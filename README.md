Are you tired of spending endless time searching for the perfect playlist on Spotify? 
After reading a post by Gabriel Gasparolo about using GenAI on iPhone, I was inspired to 
create a solution that helps you generate playlists in just 30 secondsâ€”perfectly aligned 
with the mood you want and music preferences (because, letâ€™s face it, music has the power 
to change your mood). Using simple yet powerful tools like Python, Streamlit Cloud, Spotify 
public APIs, and ChatGPT, I built an app with only 260 lines of code that generates Spotify 
playlists in under 10 secondsâ€”no coding required ðŸš€ . The best part? Iâ€™m back to enjoying music 
without the frustration of endless searching. Now, I can create playlists whenever I want, effortlessly.
